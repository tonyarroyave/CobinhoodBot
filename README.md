# CobinhoodBot

Attempt of a simple trader bot using moving averages for Cobinhood Exchange on a RPi
Supported markets:

  - BTC/USDT

#### UPDATE 19-Sept-2018

  - Right now I'm testing the scripts on the Raspberry Pi, using Supervisord as a deamon and Cron as the scheduler.
  - If everything runs without any weird behavior, next week I will post the results.
  - Soon after I'll create a script or even a Docker file to set everything up on the Raspberry Pi
