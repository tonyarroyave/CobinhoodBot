# Cobinhood - Bot
Attempt of a simple trader bot using moving averages for Cobinhood Exchange on a RPi
Supported markets: 
BTC/USDT

UPDATE 19-Sept-2018
Right now I'm testing the scripts on the Raspberry Pi, using Supervisord as a deamon and Cron as the scheduler.
If everything runs without any weird behavior, next week I will post the results and create a script or even a Docker file to set everything up on the Raspberry Pi
